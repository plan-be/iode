# IODE: Object conversions {#T1}

IODE offers several functions to import and export objects from and to various formats.

### Export {#T2}

For each output format, an IMPDEF struct (mainly a table of function pointers) must be given as argument to one of the general functions EXP\_Ws() or EXP\_Rev\_Ws() found in k\_emain.c. These functions, specific to each output format, are coded in one of the files k\_e\*.c (for ex k\_ecvs.c for csv output).

### Import {#T3}

The same logic applies to the import of object: for each import format, the general functions IMP\_InterpretVar() and IMP\_InterpretCmt() (defined in k\_emain.c) are to be fed with an EXPDEF struct (essentially a table of function pointers).

These functions, related to one input format, are coded in the files k\_i\*.c (for ex k\_iasc.c).

### Rule files {#T4}

To limit the output or input to a group of objetcs and optionally rename the objects in the output/input file, a set of rules can be specified. The syntax and logic of the rule file is explained below.

#### Definition of "Rules" {#T5}

Rules are defined in an external file and allow essentially two things :

- limit the variables to be im/exported
- determine the object name from the information available in the Ascii format.

#### Syntax of "Rules" {#T6}

Each rule is defined on one line and composed of two fields:

- the selection mask (pattern) containing a description of the names concerned by the rule. This mask is defined with the same syntax as the search in IODE objects (see Data menu), i.e. by possibly including \* and ? to specify sets.
- the name transcoding algorithm for this rule, which may contain:
- \+ : indicating that the character at this position in the source name should be included as is in the output name
- \- : any character: indicates that the character at this position in the source name should be skipped
- any other character is kept as is in the resulting name

#### Example {#T7}

```
   
    B*  C+-+            => changes B1234 to CB2, BCDEF to CBE, etc 
    *X  ++++++++++      => keeps names ending in X unchanged
```

If the rule file is empty or undefined, the default rule is used:

```
   * ++++++++++
```

#### Order of execution {#T8}

Rules are executed in the order in which they are defined in the "rule file". As soon as a rule can be applied to a name, it is used. It is therefore important to position "exceptions" at the beginning of the file and to put general rules to the end.

### Import and export source files {#T9}
