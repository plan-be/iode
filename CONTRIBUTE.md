# Preparing Python IODE Build

To prepare the building of Python IODE, please create the following conda environments:
```bash
> conda config --add channels larray-project
> conda config --add channels conda-forge
> conda create --name py39 python=3.9 numpy pandas larray cython pytest scikit-build-core (nanobind)
> conda create --name py310 python=3.10 numpy pandas larray cython pytest scikit-build-core (nanobind)
> conda create --name py311 python=3.11 numpy pandas larray cython pytest scikit-build-core (nanobind)
```

# Building Project

The different targets (libraries and executables) of the project are build using the tool CMake.

Before to build any target, make sure your CMake cache is up to date.
To rebuild the CMake cache, execute:
```bash
> cmake --preset <preset_config>
```
where the list of `<preset_config>` can be found in CMakePresets.json (buildPresets section):
- `windows-debug`
- `windows-debug-sanitize`
- `windows-release`

To build a specific target, you need to run
```bash
> cmake --build --preset <preset_config> --target <target>
```
where `<target>` is one the item in the list below:
- `iode_scr4`        -> C library providing many of the utility functions used in the C API.
- `iode_c_api`       -> Core API of IODE (in pure C).
- `iode_cpp_api`     -> C++ classes that wrap IODE C structure (used in the GUI Qt part).
- `iode_gui`         -> Graphical user interface (GUI) based on Qt.
- *(`iode_python_api`  -> Builds Python binding for IODE (based on nanobind))*
- `nsis`             -> Builds a Windows Installer for the users.
- `test_c_api`       -> Builds the tests for the C API (based on Google Test).
- `test_cpp_api`     -> Builds the tests for the C++ classes (based on Google Test).
- `iode_doc`         -> Builds the user documentation (using Python Sphinx)
- `keyboard_shortcuts` -> Builds the PDF referencing all the keyboard shortcuts in the GUI (required LaTeX).

To build the Python module for IODE (Cython), please:
1. open a Developer Command Prompt (Windows)
2. go to the root of the project
2. activate the conda environment with the Python version for which you want to create an iode package 
```bash
(...)iode> conda activate py312
```
4. run the Batch script makepy.bat
```bash
(py312) (...)iode> makepy.bat
```

# Testing Project

## C And C++ API

To test the C and C++ API, you first have to build them as explain above:
```bash
> cmake --build --preset <preset_config> --target iode_c_api
> cmake --build --preset <preset_config> --target iode_cpp_api
```

The second step is to build the tests:
```bash
> cmake --build --preset <preset_config> --target test_c_api
> cmake --build --preset <preset_config> --target test_cpp_api
```

The final and third step is to ask CMake to run the tests:
```bash
> ctest --preset c-api-<preset_config>
> ctest --preset cpp-api-<preset_config>
```

## Python API
To test the Python API:

You first have to build it and install it locally.
In a console, go to root directory of your local `iode` project.
Then type:
```bash
root_dir_iode> pip install .
```
Note: you must have cython, numpy, pandas, larray, scikit-build-core and pytest installed.

Finally, type `pytest` () :
```bash
root_dir_iode> pytest
```

# Working On An Issue

To work on (an) issue(s), create a new local branch from the remote origin/master branch.
The name of the branch must follow the template: \<your initials\>\_\<keyword\>\_\<rest\> 
where `keyword` is:
- `cli` or `cmd` when working on the IODE CLI (cmd)
- `gui` when working on the graphical user interface
- `python` when working on the Python binding for IODE
- `doc` when working on the user of dev documentation
- `nsis` when working on the Windows Installer and Updater
- `release` when preparing a new release 

Each keyword triggers a specific job in the defined Github Actions workflows (see below).
If none of the keywords above is used, the C and C++ API will be built and tested.

**IMPORTANT**: Do not forget to update the change log file of the current version. 
The change log files for each version are located in the directory doc/changes.

# Create A Release

## Before the release

1. Create a local branch based on `origin master` with the name containing the keyword `release`.
2. Replace "In development" in the last change log file (directory doc/changelog/versions) by "Released on `<current date>`".
3. Commit your changes (the commit message should be something like `release <tag> on <current date>`)
4. Create an annotated tag on the new commit.
   The name of the tag is the name of the last change log file in doc/changelog/versions (`v<major>.<minor>.<patch>(-beta.<beta>)`).
   The annotation should be something like `RELEASE: release <tag> on <current date>`.

## Push The New Tag To Github

1. Push the tag to Github: git push origin <tag_name>.
2. Check that the pushed tag has triggered the Workflow `github-actions-release.yml` in the Github Actions. Wait until the end of the `build_and_release` job. 
3. Check on Github if the new release has been created.

## After the release

1. In the directory doc/changelog/versions, create a copy of the template.rst.inc file and named it as <next_version_tag>.rst.inc.
2. Add the line `.. include:: ./changes/<next_version_tag>.rst.inc` to the changes.rst file in the directory doc/changelog.
3. Commit the changes.
4. Update all references MAJOR_VERSION.MINOR_VERSION everywhere in the project (in iode.h, documentation, ...)
5. Commit the changes.
6. Create a Pull Request and push to master.

# Github Actions

The Github Actions workflows for IODE are defined in the directory ./.github/workflows.

The sub-directory ./.github/actions contains the local actions (used in workflows).

The jobs declared in ./.github/workflows/github-actions-debug.yml are triggered according to keywords present 
in the name of the pushed branch:
- `build_and_test_api`  -> NOT triggered if the branch name contains the word `cmd`, `cli`, `gui`, `python`, `doc` or `nsis`
- `test_sanitize`       -> NOT triggered if the branch name contains the word `cmd`, `cli`, `gui`, `python`, `doc` or `nsis`
- `build_cli`           -> triggered if the branch name contains the word `cmd` or `cli`
- `build_gui`           -> triggered if the branch name contains the word `gui`
- `build_python`        -> triggered if the branch name contains either the word `python` or `nsis`
- `build_doc`           -> triggered if the branch name contains either the word `doc` or `nsis`
- `build_nsis`          -> triggered if the branch name contains either the word `nsis` or `release`

# Troubleshooting

## VS Code - IntelliSense

The IntelliSense feature (= autocomplete for C/C++) of VS Code may not be able to find where the headers files of the 
std, Boost and Qt libraries are located. 

First, add a `c_cpp_properties.json` file as indicated in the documentation for 
[developing with the C/C++ compiler MSVC with VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-msvc#_cc-configurations).

Then, in the `c_cpp_properties.json` file:

1. add the following content for `includePath`:
```
	"includePath": [
        "${workspaceFolder}/**",
        "${workspaceFolder}",
        "${workspaceFolder}/scr4",
        "C:/boost",
        "C:/Qt/6.4.2/msvc2019_64/include",
        "C:/Qt/6.4.2/msvc2019_64/include/QtCore",
        "C:/Qt/6.4.2/msvc2019_64/include/QtGui",
        "C:/Qt/6.4.2/msvc2019_64/include/QtWidgets",
        "C:/Qt/6.4.2/msvc2019_64/include/QtCharts",
        "C:/Qt/6.4.2/msvc2019_64/include/QtPrintSupport"
  ],
```
You may have to adapt the path to the Boost and Qt libraries depending on where those libraries are installed on your computer.

2. Update the value of `configurationProvider` and `compilerPath`. To find the path to your MSVC compiler, open a 
`Developer Command Prompt` and type:
```
> where cl
C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\VC\Tools\MSVC\14.38.33130\bin\Hostx64\x64\cl.exe
```

3. Restart VS Code
