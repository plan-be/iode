# IODE: tests {#T1}

The needed executables and DLLs should first be rebuilt by a call to `mk.bat`:

```
    c:/usr/iode_src/tests> mk.bat
```

Before recreating a new IODE installer, the following minimal tests must be succesful:

- iode api tests: extensive calls to iode API functions
- iodecmd tests: execution of some simple reports
- pyiode tests: extensive tests of the IODE python module in the python version currenly implemented (3.9, 3.10...)

These tests may be run by a simple call to tests/testall.bat:

```
    c:/usr/iode_src/tests> testall.bat
```

The log file `./testall.log` is generated during the process.

### Tests directory structure {#T2}

```
        ./tests/mk.bat: "make" all libs and exes needed for the tests
        ./tests/testall.bat: run all tests
        
        ./tests/cmd : iodecmd tests
            ./tests/cmd/mk.bat: rebuild iode_c_api.lib and iodecmd.exe
            ./tests/cmd/unittests.bat: run the tests on iodecmd
        
        ./tests/test_c_api: iode_c_api.lib tests
            ./tests/test_c_api/mk.bat: rebuild iode_c_api.lib, test1.exe and test1cpp.exe
            ./tests/test_c_api/unittests.bat: run the tests on iode api            
            
        ./tests/test_python: pyiode tests
```
