IODE: Estimation
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Most functions in this group are based on the book 
"Specification, Estimation and Analysis of Macroeconomic Models" by Fair (1984).

Four methods are currently proposed in IODE for the estimation of a block of equations:

&EN 0: LSQ
&EN 1: Zellner (2SLS?)
&EN 2: Instrumental Variables (IV)
&EN 3: GLS (3SLS)

No differences are made between linear and non linear equations: in both cases,
the jacobian of the system is computed numerically.

The functions related to estimation are divided in the following source files:

&EN k_est.c: functions linking the estimation package (e_*.c) to the workspaces of EQ and SCL 
&EN e_estim.c: main estimation functions 
&EN e_prep.c: construction (and destruction) of the matrices needed during the estimation process
&EN e_tests.c: calculation of statistical tests
&EN e_error.c: functions to send error messages 
&EN e_print.c: functions to print the estimation results
&EN e_dftest.c: implementation of the Dickey-Fuller test 

&EN e_step.c: moved to the report functions

&TI Estimation process
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
The main function is KE_estim() or KE_est_s() which is a more general version of KE_estim().
KE_est_s() first extracts from the current equations in KE_WS the informations needed to start the estimation: 

&EN equations in LEC form, 
&EN instruments in LEC (if any), 
&EN estimation method, 
&EN sample if not passed as argument

KE_est_s() then calls the function E_est() to (try to) estimate the coefficients. 
E_est() first gets the needed variables and scalars from KV_WS and KS_WS and then starts the estimation iteration.
If a solution is reached, 
&EN the coefficients are saved in KS_WS 
&EN E_output() is called to save the statistical tests in global matrices

The control returns to KE_est_s() which, if the solution is reached, calls E_print_results() to save in A2m a selection
of results. Finally, the statistical tests related to each equation are stored in the equations themselves.

Moreover, the same tests are saved in "volatile" scalars and variables:
&EN equation tests in scalars e<<eqnb>>_<<testname>> (e.g.: e0_dw, e1_r2...)
&EN calculated, observed and residual values in variables _YCALC, _YOBS and _YRES

These scalars and variables are "volatile" in the sense that they will be replaced in the next estimation.

&TI k_est.c
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
These functions link the data in the current workspaces (EQ, SCL) and 
the estimation package. 

Before starting the estimation itself, the values of the coefficients, 
the LEC forms, the estimation methods, etc, are read from the EQ and the SCL in the current workspaces.

After the estimation, if a solution is found, the results are stored in the workspaces by
the functions in that group.

<IODE: Equation Edition and Estimation GUI>
IODE: Equation Edition and Estimation GUI
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
In IODE, equations can be created or modified in the same window. 
There are two possible cases:

&EN If the equation exists, the user enters the edition window by selecting an equation and pressing ENTER.
&EN If an equation must be created, the user presses INS or clicks on the button "New".

In both cases, the same definition window is opened where all the informations defining the equation may be enterd/modified:
&EN endogenous variable
&EN equation in LEC
&EN optionally, estimation method and sample, equation bloc, instruments.

&IT Local and global KDBs of equations and scalars
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
During the edition of an equation, two LOCAL KDBs are maintained: one for the scalars (aka coefficients) and one for
the equations. In this way, modifications to equations / scalars remain local and are
only saved in the GLOBAL KDBs (KE_WS and KS_WS) ~bat the end of the editing process, and only 
if the user considers it relevant~B.

&IT Variables
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
If the user wants to estimate the equation, the variables found in the equation are obviously required. They are
searched in the GLOBAL kdb KV_WS. There is no LOCAL KDB of variables.

&IT Scalars
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
The scalars, on the contrary, are created on the fly if they don't exist when the equation(s) they belong are estimated.
The default value for a scalar is ~c0.9~C with a relaxation parameter set to ~c1.0~C.

If they exist in the GLOBAL KS_WS, they are copied into the local KDB and they keep their values 
as starting point for the estimation.

&IT Equations
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
The principle is the same as for scalars. Existing equations in the global KDB are copied into the local KDB 
before the edition. Unexisting ones are created with a default value of ~cENDO := 0~C.

&IT Block of equations
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
If a block of more than one equation is specified in the interface, the equations belonging to the block and 
existing in the global KDB KE_WS are copied into the local KDB. 
Unexisting ones are created in the local KDB with ~cENDO := 0~C  as LEC formula.
