# IODE: Estimation {#T1}

Most functions in this group are based on the book "Specification, Estimation and Analysis of Macroeconomic Models" by Fair (1984).

Four methods are currently proposed in IODE for the estimation of a block of equations:

- 0: LSQ
- 1: Zellner (2SLS?)
- 2: Instrumental Variables (IV)
- 3: GLS (3SLS)

No differences are made between linear and non linear equations: in both cases, the jacobian of the system is computed numerically.

The functions related to estimation are divided in the following source files:

- k\_est.c: functions linking the estimation package (e\_\*.c) to the workspaces of EQ and Scalar
- e\_estim.c: main estimation functions
- e\_prep.c: construction (and destruction) of the matrices needed during the estimation process
- e\_tests.c: calculation of statistical tests
- e\_error.c: functions to send error messages
- e\_print.c: functions to print the estimation results
- e\_dftest.c: implementation of the Dickey\-Fuller test
- e\_step.c: moved to the report functions

### Estimation process {#T2}

The main function is KE\_estim() or KE\_est\_s() which is a more general version of KE\_estim(). KE\_est\_s() first extracts from the current equations in KE\_WS the informations needed to start the estimation:

- equations in LEC form,
- instruments in LEC (if any),
- estimation method,
- sample if not passed as argument

KE\_est\_s() then calls the function E\_est() to (try to) estimate the coefficients. E\_est() first gets the needed variables and scalars from KV\_WS and KS\_WS and then starts the estimation iteration. If a solution is reached,

- the coefficients are saved in KS\_WS
- E\_output() is called to save the statistical tests in global matrices

The control returns to KE\_est\_s() which, if the solution is reached, calls E\_print\_results() to save in A2m a selection of results. Finally, the statistical tests related to each equation are stored in the equations themselves.

Moreover, the same tests are saved in "volatile" scalars and variables:

- equation tests in scalars e<eqnb>\_<testname> (e.g.: e0\_dw, e1\_r2...)
- calculated, observed and residual values in variables \_YCALC, \_YOBS and \_YRES

These scalars and variables are "volatile" in the sense that they will be replaced in the next estimation.

### k\_est.c {#T3}

These functions link the data in the current workspaces (EQ, Scalar) and the estimation package.

Before starting the estimation itself, the values of the coefficients, the LEC forms, the estimation methods, etc, are read from the EQ and the Scalar in the current workspaces.

After the estimation, if a solution is found, the results are stored in the workspaces by the functions in that group.

# IODE: Equation Edition and Estimation GUI {#T12}

In IODE, equations can be created or modified in the same window. There are two possible cases:

- If the equation exists, the user enters the edition window by selecting an equation and pressing ENTER.
- If an equation must be created, the user presses INS or clicks on the button "New".

In both cases, the same definition window is opened where all the informations defining the equation may be enterd/modified:

- endogenous variable
- equation in LEC
- optionally, estimation method and sample, equation bloc, instruments.

#### Local and global KDBs of equations and scalars {#T13}

During the edition of an equation, two LOCAL KDBs are maintained: one for the scalars (aka coefficients) and one for the equations. In this way, modifications to equations / scalars remain local and are only saved in the GLOBAL KDBs (KE\_WS and KS\_WS) **at the end of the editing process, and only if the user considers it relevant**.

#### Variables {#T14}

If the user wants to estimate the equation, the variables found in the equation are obviously required. They are searched in the GLOBAL kdb KV\_WS. There is no LOCAL KDB of variables.

#### Scalars {#T15}

The scalars, on the contrary, are created on the fly if they don't exist when the equation(s) they belong are estimated. The default value for a scalar is `0.9` with a relaxation parameter set to `1.0`.

If they exist in the GLOBAL KS\_WS, they are copied into the local KDB and they keep their values as starting point for the estimation.

#### Equations {#T16}

The principle is the same as for scalars. Existing equations in the global KDB are copied into the local KDB before the edition. Unexisting ones are created with a default value of `ENDO := 0`.

#### Block of equations {#T17}

If a block of more than one equation is specified in the interface, the equations belonging to the block and existing in the global KDB KE\_WS are copied into the local KDB. Unexisting ones are created in the local KDB with `ENDO := 0` as LEC formula.
